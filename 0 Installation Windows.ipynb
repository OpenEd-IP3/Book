    "# Installation Guide for Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "As everyone is transitioning to Windows 11, this installation guide focuses on setting up the environment on Windows 11. The guide is also applicable to Windows 10, but some steps may differ slightly; we have added differing instructions whenever required.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of this guide, you will find a section on common problems and solutions. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to that section for troubleshooting tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in setting up your Python environment is to install the Python interpreter. For the best compatibility, everyone on the team should install the same version of Python. As of 2024, it is recommended that Python 3.12 be installed. The KITT simulator requires a Python version of 3.10 or newer, so any version older than 3.10 is strongly discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Python from the Microsoft Store**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open the Microsoft Store and search for \"Python\". Install **Python 3.12** by clicking on it and then selecting \"Get\" or \"Install\".\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Note**: Installing from the Microsoft Store ensures automatic updates and easy management. However, if you prefer, you can download Python directly from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the Installation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open a command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Press the **Windows key**, type `cmd`, and hit **Enter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Type the following command and press **Enter**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This should display the installed Python version, e.g., `Python 3.12.0`. Please verify that the installed version matches the one you downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Troubleshooting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - If you receive an error like `'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, it means Python is not added to your system's PATH environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Follow this tutorial to [add Python to PATH](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/), or refer to the **Common Problems and Solutions** section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Multiple Python Versions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to specify `python3` instead of `python`:\n",
    "\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       python3 --version\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
