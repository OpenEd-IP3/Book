    "Imagine you have a book on a smooth, flat table. You can push this book in any direction you want: forward, backward, left, right, or any diagonal direction. You can also rotate it freely while sliding it. The book can go from its current position to any other position on the table directly, without any constraints on how it can move. This is an example of holonomic system.\n",

You can steer the car to the left or right, and you can drive forward or backward, but you can't just move the car sideways—like sliding it directly to the left or right without turning it. This limitation is an example of a non-holonomic constraint. \n",

    "Now in case of KIIT: You would like to move from point A to point B. You can't just magically place the KIIT into B sideways. Instead, you need to carefully maneuver—turn the wheel, move forward, adjust, move backward, and so on.You even have constrains reagarding how much you can steer left and right. And the path you take depends on the current orientation and motion of the car. This makes this a classic non-holonomic problem."
