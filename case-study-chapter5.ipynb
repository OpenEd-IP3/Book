    "A possible implementation could be as teh code below :\n",
    "\n",
    "The `challenge_A_KITT()` function is responsible for aligning KITT's trajectory to point B and driving it to reach point B using the minimum distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if KITT is \"almost there\" (line 6). If true, it calculates the distance between KITT's current position and point B (`accuracy`) and the minimum distance from KITT's trajectory to point B (`min_distance`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positioning at Point B**: If the accuracy is within a threshold (less than or equal to 20 cm), KITT stops and marks the mission as accomplished (lines 9-15). It prints the current position and accuracy, indicating that point B has been located.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed Control**: If KITT is not yet at point B, it adjusts its speed depending on the battery voltage, using higher speed when the voltage is low to conserve power (lines 19-26 and 32-39).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trajectory Alignment**: If KITT is on the route to point B (line 28), the system continues moving while adjusting the angle and speed. KITT tries to steer towards point B by calculating the error between the current and desired orientation and applying a proportional-derivative (PD) control to determine the steering angle (lines 65-74).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Steering Adjustments**: Based on the calculated steering angle, KITT adjusts its steering to either correct its trajectory or handle small deviations in its path (lines 76-97). The steering command is adjusted in degrees depending on how far KITT is from the correct trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Boundary Handling**: If KITT approaches the grid boundaries (too close to edges), it sets a safe speed and adjusts its angle to avoid going out of bounds (lines 98-105).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Final Position Update**: Once the vehicle reaches point B, or if obstacles are detected en route, the system stops and updates KITT's position. If the calculated trajectory ensures that KITT is still on course to point B (line 130), the mission proceeds as planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function also manages smaller details like ensuring obstacle avoidance and optimizing movement based on current battery levels throughout the process."

    "The code below implements obstacle detection and avoidance for KITT to complete challenges C and D. It begins by reading data from KITT’s ultrasonic sensors, which detect the distance to obstacles around the car. The function `get_distance_update()` requests distance data and decodes it to extract the distance to obstacles on the left and right sides of the car. The data is updated with an offset of 4%, as specified in the challenge. \n",

This ensures that it maintains a safe distance from obstacles, matching the requirement from the challenge to avoid collisions with a 50 cm buffer for safety.

The car then evaluates whether it should adjust its movement depending on whether the obstacle is on the left or right side, or directly in front.\n",
