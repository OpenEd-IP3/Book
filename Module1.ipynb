    "\n",
    "For this module, you will write several scripts fundamental for working with KITT for the rest of the project. For this, we will use the Python module pySerial to send and receive data to/from KITT\n",

    "### pySerial\n",
    "\n",
    "pySerial is a Python module that provides a simple and efficient way to communicate with serial ports. It allows Python programs to access and manipulate the serial ports on a computer, allowing them to communicate with other devices connected to those ports. With pySerial, you can easily send and receive data to/from these devices. pySerial is cross-platform, which works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *serial.Serial(port, baud rate)* - This command initializes a serial connection. The port argument specifies the serial port to use (e.g., \"COM1\" on Windows or \"/dev/rfcomm0\" on Linux),\n",
    "and the baud-rate argument specifies the data rate in bits per second.\n",
    "- *serial.write(data)* - This command sends data over the serial connection. The data argument is a bytes object that contains the data to be sent.\n",
    "- *serial.read(size)* - This command reads a specified number of bytes from the serial connection. It blocks until the specified number of bytes is received.\n",
    "- *serial.flush()* - This command is used to flush the input and output buffers of the serial connection.\n",
    "- *serial.close()* - This command is used to close the serial connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the basic commands used in pySerial. Depending on the specific use case, many more commands and options are available. Further more, updated information regarding the module can also be found through this link [pySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html).\n",

    "Further information regarding the issues with connecting to the port via Bluetooth can be solved by referring to the Appendices.\n",

    "Also keep in mind, The Bluetooth connection is disturbed by leaving comports open, quitting your work without closing the communication link, removing the Bluetooth dongle, or turning off the Bluetooth connection. Avoid disturbing the Bluetooth connection by ending the connection properly before doing any of the aforementioned things. If you disturb the Bluetooth link, you may need to reboot your computer to reset the operating system, which costs you valuable lab time.\n",

The MAC address of KITT always ends with the code printed on its label. For example, if the label reads DA:84, the MAC will end with xx:xx:xx:xx:DA:84.\n",
