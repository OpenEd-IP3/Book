    "# Before We Start\n",
    "\n",
    "You start the project with the Kickoff and some explanation on the car simulator. At the end of this chapter we have some guides on OOP and python packages you will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kickoff: Getting to know your team\n",
    "\n",
    "To form a team with new people is not always easy. Let’s start with a simple task: filling out a document together. Please look on Brightspace for the document *ip3_kickoff.docx* (under Content - Week 2 Kickoff). The document asks questions about how you want to collaborate as a team. Submit the document in your Brightspace assignment folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also refer to Appendix D, which describes Scrum, a technique for (ICT) project management. You should find ways to brainstorm as a team, find possible approaches to a problem (analyze the problem first!), and keep everyone busy, involved, and synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to decide is to form two sub-groups: one that will work on localization (Module 3) and the other to work on the car interface (Modules 1 and 2). After these modules are finished, Module 4 (car model) must be completed, and the mid-term report must be written according to the guidelines in the chapter 'Midterm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start doing anything, you need to set up your programming environment in Python. If you have not done so before, look at chapter 0 'Installation Linux/Mac/Windows' and follow the instructions. Besides Python, we also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and some required packages for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Car Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the Car Simulator?\n",
    "\n",
    "The car simulator is a software tool that replicates the behavior of KITT, providing a virtual environment where you can test and refine your code without needing access to the physical car. It simulates the car’s dynamics, including speed, steering, and sensor responses, reacting to the same Python commands that control the real car. This allows you to experiment with different control algorithms and get immediate feedback on how the car would behave, even when you're away from the lab. Switching between the simulator and the physical car is seamless—simply change the import statement at the top of your code to toggle between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simulator is based on the behavior of one specific car, it is important to note that each car has slight variations, which can lead to noticeable differences in performance. Factors like friction and motor efficiency can affect the accuracy of distance estimations and other dynamics. The simulator is best used for testing basic functionality—ensuring your code compiles, runs correctly, and performs simple tasks. However, the final validation should always be conducted on the real car. Additionally, some features in the simulator are simplified or idealized, such as distance sensors and audio recordings, which are based on generic settings rather than your specific configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Car Simulator Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The car simulator consists of several key components that work together to create a realistic and interactive testing environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamics Simulation Module**: This module models the physical behavior of the car, responding to inputs like throttle and steering. It factors in elements such as acceleration, deceleration, turning radius, and friction, providing realistic feedback on how the car would respond in different situations.\n",
    "2. **Serial and State Communication**: Commands can be sent to the simulator via a serial interface or a shared state file. This enables smooth communication between your Python code and the virtual car.\n",
    "3. **Sensor Simulation**: The simulator mimics the data output from physical sensors, including distance measurements and other feedback. This allows you to develop and test algorithms for tasks like feedback control and obstacle avoidance in a simulated environment.\n",
    "4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI offers a visual representation of the car’s movements, making it easy to observe its behavior in real time. You can monitor important metrics such as speed, distance traveled, and steering angle directly from the interface.\n",
    "5. **Python Integration**: The simulator is designed to be controlled using Python scripts, just like the actual car. This ensures that the code you develop for the simulator can be easily adapted for use with the physical car, minimizing the transition effort. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Programming in IP3\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, you will write over 20 functions and a couple hundred lines of code. As you will find, there is exponential difficulty with the increase in project size. Writing many functions is part of the assignment, but the challenge is testing these functions and getting them to work together. You must communicate with the car and interpret the data received, accurately find the car's location, plan how to drive to the final destination, generate steering commands, and adjust the plan while you drive and discover objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, which is a programming method that provides flexibility. It is highly recommended that you learn how to use OOP, which will be useful throughout this project and future projects. The modules will provide code snippets, assuming you understand basic OOP concepts to enhance the functionality of the KITT car project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class and object\n",
    "In OOP, a class is a template or a set of instructions for creating objects. On the other hand, an object is a specific instance or realization of that template. To illustrate, let's make a blueprint for KITT using a class."

    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that is defined outside of a class and can be called independently. It takes input arguments (if any), performs some operations, and optionally returns a result. Functions in Python are versatile and can be reused across different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "A method, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object. It is defined within a class and operates on the data associated with the class (attributes). Methods are accessed through instances of the class (objects) and can modify the state of the object. The first argument of a method is always the special variable 'self', which refers to the instance of the class."

In this header block, you should briefly describe the function, the required inputs, and what the output will do. Including a changelog with author names and dates is also good practice.\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names and write many comments so that others can understand what the code is doing.\n",
    "- Define variables for constants such as \\verb|Fs| rather than using numbers throughout the code. That way, you give meaning to that number; if the number changes, you have to change it only at a single location.\n",
    "- Avoid the use of globals. If a function needs a parameter, include it in the function call. If you must use globals, write the variable names in capitals. The risk of using globals is that if their value changes, it affects functions that depend on them while that dependency is hidden.\n",
    "- When writing your code, be sure to decouple each function, test it separately, and briefly report on these tests. If you run into any problems further down the design process, finding where functions might not agree and where your problem could lie will be easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test itself should also be in a script, so that you can frequently rerun it in case some of the functions have changed and need to be tested again. \n",
