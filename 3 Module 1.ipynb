    "# Module 1 - Connecting with and Controlling KITT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will start working with the car simulator and the car. We will provide an overview and a brief description of the vehicle, and implement some basic control scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT is a vehicle that you can control remotely, similar to a typical RC car. While traditional RC cars usually come with a joystick for control, this project has adapted the car so that you can use your computer instead. You can program your computer and use your keyboard to make KITT move forward, backward, or turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the goal of the project is to automate KITT, making it drive autonomously. As your computer will do the calculations, you will need to connect the car wirelessly to your computer. Over the wireless link, you can send commands to KITT, such as controlling its direction or speed. You can also request sensor data, which is a key difference from conventional RC cars. So this setup is a **two-way** communication link.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will learn how to set up this wireless connection and start controlling KITT using basic keyboard commands. We will use object-oriented programming. We will also do this in such a way that, by changing one line, you can swap the real car for a simulated (model) car, allowing you to test your scripts in a simulation before going into the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KITT Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT is built on a modified toy car model, the Traxxas E-MAXX (see picture below). In addition to its original components, KITT is equipped with two ultrasonic sensors, an LCD display, and the necessary electronics to transmit data via a Bluetooth connection. The LCD on the car provides real-time information, such as the readings from the distance measurement sensors and the battery voltage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Files>Datasheets>KITT datasheet.pdf, you can find a data sheet that gives a more detailed overview of the various components, such as the motor controller, LCD status indicator, ultrasonic sensors, and, most importantly, the communication module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As a heads-up for the future, when you start gathering data from KITT via the wireless link, you might notice that it doesn't always match what’s shown on the car's LCD. The data received directly from the car is more accurate, as the LCD might update at a slower rate. Therefore, while the LCD can serve as an initial indicator of any issues, it's best to rely on the direct data from the car for precise information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pictures/traxxas_e-maxx.png\" alt=\"Traxass E-MAXX along with it's dimensions\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT is equipped with a custom-made circuit board that brings together various components needed for its operation. At the heart of this board is a microcontroller, which acts as the main control unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This board also includes everything necessary for wireless communication, like the Bluetooth module, as well as connectors for other parts of the car. Additionally, there's an amplifier on the board that's used for sending out audio signals that help with localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit board is powered by rechargeable batteries. These batteries supply the necessary voltage through a component that adjusts the voltage to the required levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key components included on the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Microcontroller:** NXP LPC4357 chip with an ARM CORTEX-M4/M0 core\n",
    "- **Bluetooth module**\n",
    "- **Amplifier for the audio beacon**\n",
    "- **Buck converter** for voltage regulation\n",
    "- **Voltage regulator:** LM1117-3.3 for generating 3.3V DC\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pictures/communication_overview.png\" alt=\"Schematic of communication with KITT and PC.\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT has a Bluetooth module for communication with your PC. It consists of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On car: Roving Networks RN-41 I/RM, onboard Bluetooth module with UART control.\n",
    "- On PC: LM Technologies LM506, USB Bluetooth V4.0 dongle with Broadcom BCM20702 chipset, or the internal Bluetooth module of your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you want to use one of the lab computers or have trouble connecting to KITT from your PC (check if all drivers are installed), you could use the USB Bluetooth dongle.\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT has four LEDs on the front, see the figure below. Their meaning is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pictures/figurejoin.png\" alt=\"KITT control board and front LEDs\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red (twice):** *5V* and *20V* supply voltages are present.\n",
    "- **Green (blinking):** Bluetooth is searching for a connection; **(steady):** Bluetooth connected.\n",
    "- **Yellow (blinking):** Bluetooth data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The button next to the LEDs is a reset button for the MCU. This reset button allows the user to reset KITT's actions if it freezes or is unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The KITT test fields have limited availability. To facilitate software development and testing, you can use a KITT software model. It is in the package `KITT_Simulator`. If you use the `Serial` command from this package and connect to KITT (see below), then instead of connecting to the real car, you connect to the software model. You can send commands and read its status using the same commands as for the real KITT. Thus, you can first test all your algorithms on the simulated model and later on the real KITT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this only works if the model is sufficiently close. At some point, you'll have to adjust the parameters in the your code to match the reality of your car (calibration).\n",
    "\n",
    "To toggle between running the simulated model or the real car, look at the top block of this notebook: by commenting or uncommenting the appropriate import line, you can switch between the real car and the simulator. You will need to restart the kernel after changing this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating with KITT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we cover the essential concepts required to effectively communicate with the KITT system. In the following section, we will apply these principles in practice, implementing them in the simulator and the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pySerial\n",
    "\n",
    "`pySerial` is a Python module that provides a simple and efficient way to communicate with serial ports. It allows Python programs to access and manipulate the serial ports on a computer, allowing them to communicate with other devices connected to those ports. With `pySerial`, you can easily send and receive data to/from these devices. `pySerial` is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Serial(port, baudrate)` - This command initializes a serial connection. The `port` argument specifies the serial port to use (e.g., \"COM1\" on Windows or \"/dev/rfcomm0\" on Linux), and the `baudrate` argument specifies the data rate in bits per second.\n",
    "- `serial.write(data)` - This command sends data over the serial connection. The `data` argument is a bytes object that contains the data to be sent.\n",
    "- `serial.read(size)` - This command reads a specified number of bytes from the serial connection. It blocks until the specified number of bytes are received.\n",
    "- `serial.read_until(bytes)` - This command reads bytes from the serial connection until the specified byte sequence is found. It blocks until then.\n",
    "- `serial.flush()` - This command is used to flush the input and output buffers of the serial connection.\n",
    "- `serial.close()` - This command is used to close the serial connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed and updated information regarding the module can also be found through this link: [pySerial Documentation](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated Serial Port\n",
    "\n",
    "The KITT simulator (car model) is also controlled by a serial port. This port uses the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Serial(port, baudrate)`\n",
    "- `serial.write(data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions work identically to the `pySerial` functions, except that they communicate with the simulated KITT and not the real KITT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Controlling KITT\n",
    "\n",
    "After connecting to KITT, several commands are available to control it: driving commands, audio beacon commands, and status commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Driving Commands:** For driving, there are two types of instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A direction command: `D`. Example: `D130`\n",
    "- A motor speed command: `M`. Example: `M160`\n",
    "\n",
    "These control the motors using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Both commands are neutral at a setting of 150. The direction commands range from 200 (hard left) to 100 (hard right), and the motor commands range from 135 (backward) to 165 (forward).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** There is a dead zone for the motor commands, so KITT will likely not start moving forward until the PWM is set to about 153. It is recommended to experiment with these values; they are also battery-dependent. You should also verify that 150 is the middle position for steering (sometimes there is a deviation of ±2), and test the maximum left and right positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the commands are sent in binary over the serial link and end with a new line character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "serial.write(b'code\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To set direction to 130 and motor speed to 160, it can be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "serial.write(b'D130\\n')\n",
    "serial.write(b'M160\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Once you set the motor speed commands, KITT will continue to act on this until you either transmit a new motor speed command or reset the MCU using the button on KITT, which will set both direction and motor speed commands to the neutral value of 150. To be safe, include suitable stop commands in your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulator Example:** Let's see this in the simulator:"

    "## Implementing a Basic KITT Control Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start writing a Python program to control the simulator or the car connected over Bluetooth. This program will allow you to control the car using the keyboard keys `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d`. The `e` and `r` keys will start and stop the audio beacon, respectively. Additionally, include a key to stop communication with KITT.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by defining the `KITT` class and some essential methods for communication. Classes define the structure and capabilities of objects, allowing you to create multiple instances with the same properties and methods. Next, you will complete the `keyboard_control` function. We'll use a simple input loop to read keyboard commands. You will finally call the function and test your code first on the simulator and then on the real car.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**KITT Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__init__` Method:**\n",
    "  - Initializes the serial communication with the specified port and baud rate.\n",
    "  - Sets up the beacon parameters using the existing `send_command` method.\n",
    "- **`send_command` Method:**\n",
    "  - Sends a given command to KITT over the established serial connection.\n",
    "- **`set_speed` and `set_angle` Methods:**\n",
    "  - Adjust KITT’s speed and steering angle, respectively.\n",
    "- **`stop` Method:**\n",
    "  - Brings KITT to a halt by setting both speed and angle to their neutral states.\n",
    "- **`start_beacon` and `stop_beacon` Methods:**\n",
    "  - Control the audio beacon by sending the appropriate commands.\n",
    "- **`close` Method:**\n",
    "  - Ensures the proper closure of the serial communication when you're done using KITT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`keyboard_control` Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed as a continuous loop that reads keyboard commands from the user input.\n",
    "- Interprets the input command and adjusts KITT’s speed and steering angle or toggles the beacon accordingly.\n",
    "- **Key Mappings:**\n",
    "  - `w`: Accelerate KITT forward.\n",
    "  - `s`: Decelerate or move KITT backward.\n",
    "  - `d`: Turn KITT right.\n",
    "  - `a`: Turn KITT left.\n",
    "  - `e`: Start the audio beacon.\n",
    "  - `r`: Stop the audio beacon.\n",
    "  - `q`: Stop communication with KITT and exit the program.\n",
    "- Ensures that speed and steering values stay within the valid ranges.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and ensures resources are properly closed when exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block contains the code that will execute when you run your script.\n",
    "- An instance of `KITT` is created with the appropriate serial port.\n",
    "- The `keyboard_control` function is called with the `kitt` instance to start controlling the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modify the `__init__` Method:**\n",
    "  - When the communication with KITT is started, initialize the beacon with the correct set of parameters using the existing `serial` port and `send_command`.\n",
    "- **Add `start_beacon` and `stop_beacon` Methods:**\n",
    "  - These methods will turn the beacon on or off. Since you set the beacon parameters during `__init__`, there is no need to resend them every time you turn the beacon on.\n",
    "- **Implemented a Simple Input Loop:**\n",
    "  - Using `input()` to read commands avoids issues with keybindings in VSCode or Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "  - This method is more compatible and less likely to cause kernel crashes.\n",
    "- **Handled Exceptions and Resource Cleanup:**\n",
    "  - Added a `try...except...finally` block to handle any exceptions that might occur.\n",
    "  - Ensured that the car is stopped and the serial connection is closed when exiting the program."

    "- **Add Speed Control:** Currently, the program only supports moving the car forward or backward and turning left or right. You could add support for controlling the speed of the car, such as by sending different commands to the car depending on how long the user holds down the forward or backward keys.\n",
    "- **Add an Emergency Stop:** KITT doesn’t have a brake; the 150 speed setting lets KITT roll out to standstill, which might take a long distance. Add an emergency brake by letting KITT drive backwards for a short period of time. (You should first detect if the previous speed setting caused KITT to move forward. You need to define a state variable to memorize the speed setting.)\n",

    "For this module, you should include a chapter that covers the approach, implementation, testing, and results of the basic controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to document your code, using comments to define input/output variables of functions and to explain the logic and any modifications made. Your completed script will be crucial for the upcoming challenges, contributing to the overall autonomous driving system.\n",

    "Serial communication is a way of transmitting data one bit at a time over a single communication line. It's commonly used to connect devices like computers and microcontrollers because it simplifies wiring and is efficient for long-distance communication. In this method, data is sent in a sequence, or \"serially,\" from the sender to the receiver, typically using standards like USB, RS-232, or UART."

    "\n",
    "In a Bluetooth connection, a COM port (short for \"communication port\") is a virtual port that allows your computer to communicate with Bluetooth devices as if they were connected via a traditional serial port (like those used for older wired connections). When you pair a Bluetooth device with your computer, the operating system assigns it a virtual COM port, which acts as an interface for data exchange between your computer and the Bluetooth device. This makes it easier to send and receive data over Bluetooth using standard serial communication methods.\n"

    "A buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that steps down voltage from a higher level to a lower level while maintaining efficient power transfer. It works by rapidly switching a transistor on and off to control the energy transferred to an output capacitor, which smooths out the voltage to a lower, steady level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buck converters are used because they are highly efficient, meaning they waste very little power as heat. This efficiency is particularly important in battery-powered devices, like KITT, where it's crucial to conserve energy and maintain a stable voltage for sensitive electronics. For instance, if the battery supplies 12V but the circuit requires 5V, a buck converter efficiently reduces the voltage to the needed level without generating much heat or wasting energy.\n",

    "Pairing your Bluetooth module and assigning a COM port is different from running the Python script. If you only pair the device, you'll notice that the LED continues to blink after some time. However, when you run the Python script and the virtual COM port is properly allocated, the LED will stop blinking. Simply pairing the device isn't enough to stop the LED from blinking—you need to run the Python script as instructed to see the LED become stable which means there is an actual connection."

    "\n",
    "Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electronic device by varying the width of the pulses in a signal. It works by switching a signal on and off rapidly at a constant frequency, and by adjusting the ratio of the \"on\" time to the \"off\" time, you can control the average power delivered to a load.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a signal is \"on\" for 50% of the time and \"off\" for the other 50%, the output will deliver 50% of the maximum power. This method is commonly used in applications like controlling the speed of motors, dimming LED lights, and generating analog signals from digital sources because it is efficient and provides precise control over power.\n"
