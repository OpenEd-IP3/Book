    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EE2T11 Telecommunication A course lab (??@B update), you developed algorithms for channel estimation for 2 microphone signals, both receiving a beacon (training) signal. In the present module, we extend this to 5 microphones and use this to locate the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The channel estimation problem is the following: Suppose we transmit a known signal $x[n]$ over a communication channel, and measure the result $y[n]$.  The channel acts as a\n",
    "filter, which we will assume to be linear and time-invariant.\n",
    "Therefore, the measured signal is a convolution of the transmitted\n",
    "signal by the channel impulse response $h[n]$, such that\n",
    "$y[n] = h[n] \\ast x[n]$.  Knowing the transmitted signal $x[n]$, can\n",
    "we recover the impulse response of the communication channel from\n",
    "$y[n]$?  This is essentially an inversion problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate $h[n]$, three alternative algorithms were described:\n",
    "- __ch1__ Deconvolution in the time domain: Involves matrix inversion. It is computationally complex and requires lots of memory (easily more than what the available PCs can handle).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __ch2__ The matched filter: Avoids the matrix inversion. It is equal to computing the cross-correlation of\n",
    "$y[n]$ with $x[n]$. As cross-correlation is equivalent to a convolution with a reverse signal $x[−n]$, it can be computed efficiently using the FFT. The resulting channel estimate is equal to the true\n",
    "channel convolved with the autocorrelation of the pulse, $x[n] ∗ x[−n]$. Therefore, its performance\n",
    "heavily depends on having the correct (i.e., accurate) “reference” or “training” signal to correlate\n",
    "your measurements with, and the signal should have good autocorrelation properties: $x[n] ∗ x[−n]$\n",
    "should be close to a delta spike. Large sidelobes will lead to confusion.\n",
    "- __ch3__ Deconvolution in the frequency domain: Involves the FFT. It computes the same channel as via\n",
    "deconvolution in the time domain but is much more efficient: convolution in time becomes point-\n",
    "wise multiplication in frequency, hence for deconvolution in the frequency domain, we only need\n",
    "a pointwise division, followed by an IFFT to obtain the time-domain channel impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Note\n",
    "\n",
    "FFT and IFFT lead to periodicities (the result is cyclic, and samples $x[n]$ at negative time reappear\n",
    "at the “large n” part of the signal). Since this method is similar to ch1 (but much more efficient),\n",
    "you can view this method as a matched filter, followed by a correction step that “inverts” the effect\n",
    "of the autocorrelation of the transmit pulse. However, since we should not divide by zero, you will\n",
    "also need to implement a “threshold” to set non-invertible or very small frequency coefficients of\n",
    "$x[n]$ to zero, which otherwise will lead to noise amplification. The performance depends on this\n",
    "threshold, which has to be chosen heuristically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is assumed that you have working algorithms for estimating channel responses. You developed these during the EE2T11 Telecommunication A practicum (??@B). We recommend using ch3: deconvolution in the\n",
    "frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, a reference signal $x[n]$ is required. We recommend using a recording close to the beacon because then $x[n]$ includes the loudspeaker and microphone responses as well. For the pre-made recordings, a high-quality reference is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The deconvolution algorithm gives a channel estimate for the beacon path to each microphone. After this, we detect the first incoming path, which, assuming Line of Sight (LOS), corresponds to the propagation delay of the car beacon to each microphone. Unfortunately, we do not know the transmit time, so we only obtain relative propagation delays. If we take the difference of microphone delays, this unknown transmit time is eliminated, so we can obtain time difference of arrival (TDOA) samples for each microphone pair.\n",
