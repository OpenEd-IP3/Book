# Setup and Preliminary Instructions

Welcome to the first step in setting up your initial environment and utilising the tools locally. 

This page describes how you will interact with Python in this course, specifically via Jupyter Notebooks.  In a nutshell, if you string many of these cells together into a single digital document, you more or less end up with a Jupyter Notebook, run and save the cells in any order, as well as type formatted text in between. There is no need to install special software!

## Python on your PC

If you want to explore Python programming and Jupyter ecosystems beyond the exercises covered in this course, it might be worthwhile to install a Python distribution on your own computer. The most common and easiest way to do this is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Installation instructions are not included in this course, but you can find plenty of website of videos that cover this, as well as using the Anaconda Navigator to open a Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook environment. Most of the pages in this online textbook can be downloaded in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file (a file ending with **.ipynb**): open it via one of the Jupyter environments and you are ready to go! On the other hand, installing Python separately using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and downloading the necessary packages and environments. 


## Introduction to Python

The main programming language dealt with in this course Python. The base code for which follows for msot versions and can run independently on local devices as well using the Live code option in this site. 

```{admonition} Interactive Pages - use your browser!
Live code is a feature provided in this website in order to directly run the scripts here without having to move to different websites for the same. 
```

You would also find this material helpful if you require a refresher in basic Python Skills, knowledge regarding classes and OOPS concepts.

## Environment and variables

Python environments/virtual environments are used for project isolation and dependency management. They can be set up to specify a specific Python version for the project and install packages locally in the virtual environment directory. Consequently, the dependencies (or packages) are isolated from the global environment, avoiding conflicts between dependency requirements of different projects and allowing for
the installation of a specific dependency version. 
In this project a specific environment is used to access all the packages and environment variables. So after the virtual environment is created, the installation can be verified and can exit when required.
