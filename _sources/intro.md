# Introduction to IP3: Autonomous Driving Challenge

Welcome!

We are excited for you all to join us in this course designed for students to work with concepts involving signal processing, telecommunication, programming (Python) and autonomous driving. 

The goal of the project is to use an electric toy car (with added functionality) which can be remotely operated, to detect obstacles in front of it and communicate with a base station (essentially your own personal computer device) to perform localisation, trajectory tracking and collision avoidance. 
The car called ''KITT'' can communicate to a base station (your computer) via Bluetooth and has a pair of distance (anti-collision) sensors and an audio beacon on top. During a final competition, you are asked to demonstrate your achievements in several ''tasks'', i.e., races of increasing difficulty. All of which will be explained further in detail in the form of modules and snippets of code to aid each task.

It starts off with some introductory modules for installation and basic concepts, followed by the modules related to the physics of the car and system integration. 

## Modules

The modules are as follows, 
1. Installation and Setup
2. Basics
    - Project
    - Python
    - Signal processing
3. Communicating with KITT. (Modules 1 and 2)
4. Localization using microphones. (Module 3)
5. Path planning and System integration. (Modules 4 and 5)

Division of tasks can be done according to the communication with KITT and developing the localization algorithm.
