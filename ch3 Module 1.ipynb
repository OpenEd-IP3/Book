    "## Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT is a small vehicle that you can control remotely, in manyways similar to a typical RC car. While traditional RC cars usually come with a joystick for control, this project has adapted the car so that you can use your computer instead. So for the manual control instead of using a joystick, you control the car with your keyboard, where pressing different keys can make it move forward, backward, or turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, manual control is not the main focus of this project. As you gain experience in sending commands and receiving data from the car, you will be able to write a program that automates KITT's movements, eliminating the need for manual control.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this remote control system to function, KITT needs to be wirelessly connected to your computer. This wireless connection allows you to send commands to KITT, such as controlling its direction or speed. Additionally, KITT can send information back to your computer, such as sensor data or battery level, which is a key difference from conventional RC cars. So this setup is a **two-way** communication link.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first part, you will learn how to set up this wireless connection and start controlling KITT using basic commands. This will build a foundation for more advanced tasks, such as programming you PC and connect it with KITT to navigate it autonomously."

    "### KITT Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "KITT is built on a modified toy car model, the Traxxas E-MAXX (see picture below). In addition to its original components, KITT is equipped with two ultrasonic sensors, an LCD display, and the necessary electronics to transmit data via a Bluetooth connection. The LCD on the car provides real-time information, such as the readings from the distance measurement sensors and the battery voltage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** There is a data sheet as well which gives an overview of the various components, such as the motor controller, LCD status indicator, ultrasonic sensors, and, most importantly, the communication module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As a heads-up for the future, when you start gathering data from KITT via the wireless link, you might notice that it doesn't always match what’s shown on the car's LCD. The data received directly from the car is more accurate, as among other reasons the LCD might update at a slower rate. Therefore, while the LCD can serve as an initial indicator of any issues, it's best to rely on the direct data from the car for precise information.\n",

    "KITT is equipped with a custom-made circuit board that brings together various components needed for its operation. At the heart of this board is a microcontroller, which acts as the main control unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This board also includes everything necessary for wireless communication, like the Bluetooth module, as well as connectors for other parts of the car. Additionally, there's an amplifier on the board that's used for sending out audio signals that help with localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit board is powered by rechargeable batteries. These batteries supply the necessary voltage through a component that adjusts the voltage to the required levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key components included on the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Microcontroller:** NXP LPC4357 chip with an ARM CORTEX-M4/M0 core\n",
    "- **Bluetooth module**\n",
    "- **Amplifier for the audio beacon**\n",
    "- **Buck converter** for voltage regulation\n",
    "- **Voltage regulator:** LM1117-3.3 for generating 3.3V DC\n",

    "As KITT has a bluethoth module for communication you can use your computer's internal Bluetooth connector to connect to KITT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bluetooth communication with KITT consists of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  On car: Roving Networks RN-41 I/RM, Onboard Bluetooth module with UART control.\n",
    "-  On PC: LM Technologies LM506, USB Bluetooth V4.0 dongle with Broadcom BCM20702 chipset, or the internal Bluetooth module of your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you want to use one of the lab computers or have trouble connecting to KITT from your PC (check if all drivers are installed), you can use the USB Bluetooth dongle.\n",

    "KITT has four LED's on the front, see the figure below, their meaning is as follows:\n",

    "![KITT](figurejoin.png)\n",

    "*Kitt control board and front LEDS*\n",

    "- Red (twice): *5V* and *20V* supply voltages are present.\n",
    "- Green (blinking): Bluetooth searches for connection; (steady) Bluetooth connected.\n",
    "- Yellow (blinking): Bluetooth data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The button next to the LEDs is a reset button for the MCU. This reset button allows the user to reset KITT's actions if it freezes or is unresponsive."

    "\n",
    "Serial communication is a way of transmitting data one bit at a time over a single communication line. It's commonly used to connect devices like computers and microcontrollers because it simplifies wiring and is efficient for long-distance communication. In this method, data is sent in a sequence, or \"serially,\" from the sender to the receiver, typically using standards like USB, RS-232, or UART."

    "\n",
    "In a Bluetooth connection, a COM port (short for \"communication port\") is a virtual port that allows your computer to communicate with Bluetooth devices as if they were connected via a traditional serial port (like those used for older wired connections). When you pair a Bluetooth device with your computer, the operating system assigns it a virtual COM port, which acts as an interface for data exchange between your computer and the Bluetooth device. This makes it easier to send and receive data over Bluetooth using standard serial communication methods.\n"

    "A buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that steps down voltage from a higher level to a lower level while maintaining efficient power transfer. It works by rapidly switching a transistor on and off to control the energy transferred to an output capacitor, which smooths out the voltage to a lower, steady level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buck converters are used because they are highly efficient, meaning they waste very little power as heat. This efficiency is particularly important in battery-powered devices, like KITT, where it's crucial to conserve energy and maintain a stable voltage for sensitive electronics. For instance, if the battery supplies 12V but the circuit requires 5V, a buck converter efficiently reduces the voltage to the needed level without generating much heat or wasting energy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pairing your Bluetooth module and assigning a COM port is different from running the Python script. If you only pair the device, you'll notice that the LED continues to blink after some time. However, when you run the Python script and the virtual COM port is properly allocated, the LED will stop blinking. Simply pairing the device isn't enough to stop the LED from blinking—you need to run the Python script as instructed to see the LED would be stable which means there is an actualy connection."

    "\n",
    "Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electronic device by varying the width of the pulses in a signal. It works by switching a signal on and off rapidly at a constant frequency, and by adjusting the ratio of the \"on\" time to the \"off\" time, you can control the average voltage and power delivered to a load.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a signal is \"on\" for 50% of the time and \"off\" for the other 50%, the output will deliver 50% of the maximum power. This method is commonly used in applications like controlling the speed of motors, dimming LED lights, and generating analog signals from digital sources because it is efficient and provides precise control over power.\n"
