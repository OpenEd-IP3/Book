Nevertheless, a few hints are given in this chapter on how you could attack the problem (but many alternative solution approaches exist).\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this second part, it merits to brainstorm with your entire group on the approach\n",
    "that you will take. For your selected approach, determine whether it will do the job (and under what assumptions/conditions). You can opt for a simple and robust “combinatorial” approach (i.e., based on\n",
    "many if-then-else statements), that will be able to handle the expected situations but not more than that,\n",
    "or a more thoughtful approach based on control theory, that is much more robust but also more risky to\n",
    "implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "This high-level system design is part of system engineering, i.e., with the entire system in mind, define\n",
    "an approach at a high level that will do the job, and define specifications of each constituting subsystem.\n",
    "These parts can then be designed by specialists that don’t have to know or consider the entire system. If\n",
    "the parts are tested and verified to meet their specifications, then the entire system is supposed to work.\n",
    "(Or so you would think.)\n",

    "**Deliverable**\n",

    "In your final report, document your selected approach, and the alternatives that you considered, plus your\n",
    "motivation for the selection.\n",

    "Document the foreseen consequences of this choice. Draw a block scheme that shows what software\n",
    "blocks should interact, and define the interaction (e.g., variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will probably contain a finite state machine and/or a loop. An important consideration is\n",
    "the timing of this loop. Document your analysis of this in sufficient detail. How often do you intend to\n",
    "measure your location, keeping in mind the constraints and trade-offs here. Consider also the various\n",
    "delays in the system. If you obtain a location fix, how old is that information? If you estimate velocity\n",
    "from two locations, then to what time point does that velocity refer? How fast should one iteration of the\n",
    "loop be? (If it is too fast, then you won’t have new location information, but if it is too slow, then you\n",
    "might miss your target.) Can you merge location fixes from the audio beacon with predictions of your\n",
