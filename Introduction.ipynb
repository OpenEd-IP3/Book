    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the EE2L21 EPO-4 project option 'KITT: autonomous driving challenge'. In this 5 EC project, you and your team will take a remotely operated electric toy car and make it drive autonomously. The car called 'KITT' can communicate to a base station (your computer) via Bluetooth and has a pair of distance (anti-collision) sensors and an audio beacon on top. During a final competition, you are asked to demonstrate your achievements in several 'challenges', i.e., races of increasing difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the previous projects, the objective of EPO-4 is to apply and integrate the EE knowledge you have acquired so far. This entails signal transforms, telecommunication, system modeling and control, and digital signal processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This manual starts with a description of the overall project. This complex task is split into modules, each contributing to the overall goal. You have already designed a TDOA distance estimation algorithm in the lab sessions of EE2T11 Telecommunication A, and you will now integrate this into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of the project is to take a standard toy car with added functionality so that it can be remotely operated, can detect obstacles in front of it, and can communicate with a base station (your PC), which performs calculations such as location estimation, trajectory tracking, and collision avoidance as shown in the figure below. You will have to write these functionalities. You will also have to document the designs in your reports, describe the design choices, and evaluate the test results. Lastly, you will have to present and defend your reports and designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](intro_setup.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the final challenge, the car is positioned at a known location. The car should drive autonomously to the target while avoiding obstacles like boxes and competing cars. The car is equipped with anti-collision sensors and a localization beacon. A bidirectional RF link will provide a connection of the car to a base station (PC) that allows the transfer of the anti-collision ranging measurements, and to receive actuation instructions (motor control and control of the equipment on the car).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complex assignment, which is therefore split into several modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Communicating with KITT (Modules 1 and 2)\n",
    "- Localization using microphones (Module 3)\n",
    "- Car Model (Module 4)\n",
    "- State tracking and control (Module 5)\n",
    "- System integration\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of the entire system is shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:systemoverview}. In the control loop, the virtual car model (``digital twin'') predicts the car position (and its velocity and orientation), and this is used to assist in tracking the state without independent position estimate from the microphones. This block is not absolutely necessary; however, without it, you probably need a pretty good localization system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total duration of the project is $9$ weeks. Each week, you have two lab sessions; outside of the lab, you must prepare the lab assignments, homework, and report writing. The project is finished with the Final Challenge (demo session, week 9) and the Presentation and Defense (committee interview, week 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](systemoverview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the project, you will have built a system with the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Connecting to and controlling KITT* module consists of setting up an RF connection to KITT and writing a program that allows you to control KITT and drive it around. The connection is provided by off-the-shelf Bluetooth modules, controlled by a microcontroller on the car and an interface on the base station PC. The microcontroller can also generate motor control signals using basic commands from the base station PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Reading KITT* sensor data and detecting objects module consists of reading and using the data from the anti-collision sensors and the microphones along the field. These distance sensors are a pair of off-the-shelf ultrasonic transmitters/receivers that can detect objects in front of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The maximal range of the detection is about $6$ m.\n",
    "    - The system is mounted on the car.\n",
    "    - The system is controlled by the onboard microcontroller and read out via the RF link.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Loclization using audio communication* is done by transmitting a repetitive beacon signal from the car.  This is an audio signal, and it may be corrupted by interfering signals emitted by other cars present in the field (depending on whether you choose to do this challenge), and by surrounding noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The audio signals from all cars are captured by multiple microphones placed along the field.  The analog microphone signals are sampled and made available to you.\n",
    "    - There are 5 microphones around the field, of which the location is known.\n",
    "    - The estimation of the location is done in Python by using the microphone data and the TDOA you developed in the EE2T11 Telecommunications A practicum.  \n",
    "    - The location updates should be frequent and accurate enough for the trajectory tracking to function. (Minimal numbers are at least one update per $2$ seconds, with an accuracy better than 30cm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Control and Trajectory tracking* is based on a sufficiently accurate system model of the car, both regarding velocity and steering behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The state of KITT consists of position, velocity, and orientation (4 parameters).\n",
    "    - The velocity model is based on differential equations that take the speed settings into account.\n",
    "    - The steering behavior is based on modeling the trajectory resulting from a steering command.\n",
    "    - The model of the car should allow you to predict the next state of the car, given the current state and the control input.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *System Integration* brings your previously done work together. KITT's starting location and orientation are known, and from this you will have to route KITT to certain points in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The system you make must be closed loop, control input is from your localization algorithm that uses an audio beacon on top of the car, additionally you may have to use the data from the anti-collision sensors. It is important to note that ``open loop'' solutions will not be accepted. These types of solutions have hard-coded timings or control actions that can only address a single scenario.\n",
    "    - The control actions are computed in Python on your base station PC. \n",
    "    - After the start of the challenge, you are not allowed to touch the base station PC.\n",
    "    - The main considerations in the design are the proper managing of uncertainties in localization, state updates, and real-time aspects: the car drives while estimating its location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functionalities is specified in its own module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teamwork Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective teamwork is crucial for the success of the project. Given that your team consists of four or sometimes five students, it is advisable to divide the work into parallel work packages. For the first weeks, we suggest to follow the Modules, e.g.*Communicating with KITT*and *Localization algorithm development*. In the second phase of the project, a path planning algorithm has to be created, which takes the location of the car and the target as input and generates a set of waypoints to get there. The control part should then send commands to KITT to drive to these locations. A detailed car model will help to develop and debug your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communicating with KITT \n",
    "\n",
    "Two team members can focus on the communication aspect. This involves establishing a reliable and efficient communication link between the computer (base station) and KITT. Tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing communication over Bluetooth.\n",
    "- Developing functions to send commands to KITT.\n",
    "- Creating modules to read sensor data from KITT.\n",
    "- Characterizing the sensors and motions of KITT.\n",
    "- Make recordings using the microphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication with KITT is discussed in Modules 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Localization algorithm development\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two team members can focus on the localization algorithm. This involves processing audio data from the microphones to estimate the location of KITT. Tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Developing a channel estimation algorithm for received audio signals. (A basis for this has been designed during the course labs of Telecommunications A)\n",
    "- Implementing Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculations.\n",
    "- Using TDOA data locate KITT\n",
    "- Handling data synchronization and ensuring accuracy in localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is further explained in Module 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "You maximize efficiency and expertise by assigning dedicated team members to each area in parallel, as only so many people can type on a keyboard simultaneously. Remember that effective communication within the team is critical. Regular updates, meetings, and shared documentation will help keep everyone on the same page and facilitate successfully integrating the individual components into the autonomous driving system. To better understand what the other group is working on, it is advisable to read the manual on the other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible approach to organizing teamwork follows the 'Scrum' or 'Agile' methodology. In this approach, a project evolves iteratively, producing a functional system in each iteration (“sprint”). A description of the Scrum method is given in Appendix D.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find that working in parallel is only possible if you define clear interfaces: e.g., route planning is only possible if it is clear how accurate the localization algorithm works. In turn, the localization algorithm must know time stamps to know how 'old' the microphone data is, and produce a time stamp telling how old the location fix is. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Educational Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "General learning objective: To integrate different technical areas related to electronic systems, signal processing and control. The educational objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased skills in building and testing electronic systems. Software skills mainly consist of advanced Python programming.\n",
    "- Increased skills in measurement techniques, e.g., wireless channel measurements.\n",
    "- Application of course material from various courses: control systems, linear algebra, signal transformations, digital signal processing, telecommunication.\n",
    "- Increased academic skills related to project management: **managing an open and complex assignment, planning,** acquiring background literature, **working in teams** (distributing tasks among team members, communicating within and among subgroups), **reporting**, oral presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difficulties students have with this project are the complexity of the overall system and planning. You will split up your team into two sub-groups. Each delivers Python code that later has to be integrated and function together. Nobody on the team has complete, detailed knowledge of the entire design. If you don’t manage this, then you will fail. Essential parts to make this work are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *System Engineering:*  At an early stage, agree on an overall structure for your design, partition it into modules, and decide on specifications for the modules. Find the essential aspects that need to be done right. For this system, uncertainty in time and position plays an important role. For example, the car moves while the localization is being computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Testing:* Each module should have a clearly defined specification, and the Python code should be tested and verified against the specifications before it is integrated into the overall system. You cannot debug the overall system if you are unsure about its parts!\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Planning:* You will probably find that there is insufficient time in the testing areas: it is available to your team only about 25\\% of the time, and with two sub-groups, you will also compete within your team. Thus, you must plan well on what you want to measure and test during your time slot in the testing area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Modeling:* To avoid waiting for precious testing time, it is advisable to create a (simple or more advanced) software *car model*, such that you are able to test your algorithms on the model. This also allows you to verify in detail the performance of your algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Schedule and Deadlines\n",
    "\n",
    "EPO-4 has $14$ scheduled lab sessions (distributed over $9$ weeks due to\n",
    "holidays). Outside of these sessions, you will have time to prepare and work on the report. In week $9$, there is a common session for the final challenge, and in week $10$, you will be called for a final presentation followed by a discussion. The total lab time is $56$ hours, and preparation/homework time is budgeted at $84$ hours, for a total study load of $5$ EC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table \\ref{tab:schedule and deadlines} shows a generic schedule. For the specific dates this year, look in Brightspace!  The planning regarding the completion of the modules is flexible, but the deadlines are firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many groups compete for time on the test fields: 4 to 5 groups share the same field. You must reserve time slots on one of these systems using a planner in Brightspace. Come prepared with a measurement/test plan!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Assessment and reports\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mid-term assessment and report\n",
    "\n",
    "In weeks $4$ and/or $5$, you are asked to demonstrate the functionality and performance of your communication, localization and car model scripts to your TA. After their approval, you are ready to write your mid-term report, detailing your approach, implementation, and test results for Modules 1--4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sign-off Modules 1,2: Communication script assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your communication script, you are asked to demonstrate that you can control your car using the WASD or arrow keys on the keyboard. You should be able to transmit the beacon signal and record it using the 5 microphones. The detailed requirements are outlined in Modules 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sign-off Module 3: Localization script assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your localization script, you are asked to demonstrate that you can locate the car from recordings that are given to you. (Integration with your own car is not yet necessary.) Refer to the specifications outlined in Module 3 for detailed requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sign-off Module 4: Car model assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 4, you are asked to write a basic car model that captures the dynamics of KITT: its response to driving and steering commands. You do this based on measurements of its behavior, along with simple equations of motion. The goal of this model is to be able to predict the location of KITT after a few seconds of driving. You can also use this model to test your control algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You demonstrate your car model by predicting the position of KITT after a short series of commands, and by comparing this to the actual outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mid-term report\n",
    "\n",
    "You submit a report of approximately $15$ pages (plus cover page and appendix) documenting your work until now.\n",
    "More details on the structure and contents of this report are in Chapter Mid-term report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Challenge and Report\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude the project, your design is tested during the final challenge. The tests will be described briefly here and in more detail in the System integration chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final challenge starts at a known location and orientation. At a start signal, you have to drive autonomously to a target. If you complete the task successfully, you may take on more complex tasks, including additional waypoints, obstacles, and other cars. It is required to reach the target with a certain minimal accuracy. Bonus points are obtained by the fastest team for each challenge. During the race, it is not allowed to touch the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed is not the main requirement in this challenge. You may reach the target faster by driving faster, but navigating becomes more complex, location updates must be computed more quickly, and you have less time to avoid obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final report\n",
    "\n",
    "The project outcome is documented in a final report. The report must follow a structured approach, which you have learned in previous projects; the midterm report is a part of it. Use a to-the-point, concise, but complete reporting style. Provide an appendix with all Python code. More details on this report are in the System integration chapter. Your report is submitted in the corresponding submission folder in Brightspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report without an appendix should be about 30 pages. Within these pages, you must document your design choices, explain your control systems, and report the deliverables of all modules, how you combined these modules, and what problems you ran into and solved them. The focus is on your findings and measurement results and the corresponding conclusions. You are also judged regarding project skills such as planning and teamwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final presentation and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In week $10$ (consult Brightspace for the exact date), you present and defend your final report before an examination committee. The examiners will ask questions about your design choices and aspects of teamwork. This will be part of your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation lasts at most $5$ min. This is too short to have all team members presenting. Focus on the highlights and special features of the design, and mention the work breakdown and distribution of tasks to team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "While each team member may not have been directly involved in every aspect of the project, through open communication and collaboration, all team members are expected to have an operating understanding of all parts of the project. During the discussion, detailed questions will be asked to the group. The team member with the best subject knowledge is encouraged to answer. However, less complex questions can be asked to anyone to test their participation in the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The examination will last about $30$ min. After the examination, you will be asked to fill in a peer review form. Individual grades are differentiated depending on staff observations and the outcome of the peer review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade depends on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mid-term report ($30\\%$);\n",
    "- Performance during the final challenge ($20\\%$);\n",
    "- Final report ($35\\%$);\n",
    "- Oral presentation and defense ($15\\%$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Teamwork is important. Your individual grade may differ depending on staff observations and peer reviews. There is a penalty for submitting the report late.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your final grade is insufficient, you may have a chance to improve your grade by improving your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is carried out at the Tellegen Hall facilities in A and B teams. Each team has 2 sessions per week. The hall has three testing areas, each shared by 4 teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following support is available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Student assistants*; student assistants are your primary help. Each assistant supports up to four teams. Assistants also check attendance and progress.\n",
    "- *Instructors*; Practicum coordinators are available at each lab session. The coordinators also grade your reports.\n",
    "- *Technical support*; for questions about hardware and implementation issues, you can contact the student assistants and/or the technicians at the facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the Brightspace page of the course for support and contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules and Regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the rules and regulations of the EEE group on the use of the Tellegen Hall, the following rules and regulations are applicable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are expected to be present during your scheduled lab sessions. If you cannot attend for a good reason, contact your assigned TA *before* the lab session.  Absence more than two times will not be allowed; you will be removed from the practicum. \n",
    "- Preparation for labdays is *mandatory*. This project has an intense pace and limited time; use it wisely. The scheduled homework time is needed.\n",
    "- You may not work alone in the lab. A student assistant or staff member must be present.\n"
