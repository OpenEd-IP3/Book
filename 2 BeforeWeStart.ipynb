    "# Before We Start\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting to know your team\n",
    "\n",
    "To form a team with new people is not always easy. Letâ€™s start with a simple task: filling out a document together. Please look on Brightspace for the document *epo4_kickoff.docx*. The document asks questions about how you want to collaborate as a team. Submit the document in your Brightspace assignment folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also refer to Appendix D, which describes Scrum, a technique for (ICT) project management. You should find ways to brainstorm as a team, find possible approaches to a problem (analyze the problem first!), and keep everyone busy, involved, and synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to decide is to form two sub-groups: one that will work on localization (Module 3) and the other to work on the car interface (Modules 1 and 2). After these modules are finished, Module 4 (car model) must be completed, and the mid-term report must be written according to the guidelines in Chapter Midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start doing anything, you need to set up your programming environment in Python.  If you have not done so before, this chapter will guide you on the essential steps to installing Python on your laptop or PC.  We also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and some required packages for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the keyboard and timer package, a short tutorial is provided here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in setting up your Python environment is to install the Python interpreter. The installation process is slightly different for Windows, Linux, and Mac. For the best compatibility, everyone on the team should install the same version of Python. As of 2024, it is recommended that Python 3.12 be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, follow these steps to install Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Microsoft store, and search for \"Python\". Install the latest version.\n",
    "2. To verify the installation, open a command prompt and type:\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "This should display the installed Python version. Please verify that the installed version matches the one you downloaded from the Microsoft store. If not, follow this tutorial: [How to add Python to PATH](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/), or ask a TA for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "For macOS users, an old version of Python is pre-installed, do not use this. Python3 needs to be installed, for this follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your web browser and navigate to the official Python website at [Pythonwebsite](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on the ''Downloads'' tab, and you will see a button for the latest version of Python. Click on it to initiate the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once the installer is downloaded, run the executable file. The installer will walk you through a wizard to complete the installation, and in most cases, the default settings work well, so install it like the other applications on macOS. You may also have to enter your Mac password to let it know that you agree with installing Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. To verify the installation, open a command prompt and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux users, an old version of Python is often pre-installed, do not use this. You can use the package manager specific to your distribution to install Python. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Update your package manager's repository information:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "    sudo apt update  # For Debian/Ubuntu\n",
    "```    \n",
    "3. Install Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "    sudo apt install python3  # For Debian/Ubuntu\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. To verify the installation, type:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "    python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This should display the installed Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). VSCode is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft with a wide range of extensions and excellent Python support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you are allowed to use another IDE, such as PyCharm (you can get a premium account using your @student.tudelft.nl email address).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows, macOS, and Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your web browser and navigate to the official VSCode website at [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Click on the \"Download\" button to download the installer suitable for your operating system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Once the installer is downloaded, run it to start the installation process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You can choose the default settings unless you have specific preferences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. After the installation is complete, open Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python extension for VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "VSCode is very popular because of its use of extensions. This makes it compatible with almost any programming language or development board (such as Arduino). In our case, you have to add Python support to the IDE. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open VSCode.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. In the Extensions view search bar, type ''Python''.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Look for the official Python extension by Microsoft and click ''Install''. This extension provides enhanced support for Python development.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. After installation, you may need to reload VSCode to activate the Python extension fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing required packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a well supported language with many possibilities. These possibilities come from the many libraries and packages that are built by users. Because we do not want to rewrite all the essentials, we will use a list of required packages that every user has to install. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install these packages, go to the directory were you want to work on EPO-4. In this directory paste the \"requirements.txt\" file from Brightspace. Follow the instructions based on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Windows 11:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal in your EPO-4 directory and run the following command:\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",

    "Open a terminal in your EPO-4 directory and run the following command:\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "pip install -r requirements_student.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "The appropriate sound card driver must be used to use the microphone array. The soundcard used in EPO-4 is a PreSonus AudioBox 1818VSL. On Windows 10, it is necessary to install ASIO4ALL [ASIO4ALL](https://www.asio4all.org/) and a build of PyAudio compiled with ASIO support [PyAudio](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).\n",
    "\n",
    "### For MacOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal and install Homebrew using:\n",

    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will ask you for confirmation, and your password. If prompted run the follow up commands.\n",
    "Afterwards, install portAudio using Homebrew, this fills the gaps in some packages that are needed to use the microphones: \n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "brew install portaudio\n",
    "```\n",
    "Open a terminal in your EPO-4 directory and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell}\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements_student.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Programming in EPO-4\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, you will write over 20 functions and a couple hundred lines of code. As you will find, there is exponential difficulty with the increase in project size. Writing many functions is part of the assignment, but the challenge is testing these functions and getting them to work together. You must communicate with the car and interpret the data received, accurately find the car's location, plan how to drive to the final destination, generate steering commands, and adjust the plan while you drive and discover objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, which is a programming method that provides flexibility. It is highly recommended that you learn how to use OOP, which will be useful throughout this project and future projects. You can find the code used in this tutorial on Brightspace. The manual will provide code examples, assuming you understand basic OOP concepts to enhance the functionality of the KITT car project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class and object\n",
    "In OOP, a class is a template or a set of instructions for creating objects. On the other hand, an object is a specific instance or realization of that template. To illustrate, let's make a blueprint for KITT using a class.\n"

    "The above tutorial briefly introduced OOP in Python and demonstrated its application in the KITT car project. However, some of these concepts can be abstract when first introduced. Therefore, you should look for more resources as you experiment with OOP.\n",

    "- When writing the code to implement functionalities required for this project, partition the code into separate functions and always include a header block with a function. In this header block, you should briefly describe the function, the required inputs, and what the output will do. Including a changelog with author names and dates is also good practice.\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names and write many comments so that others can understand what the code is doing.\n",
    "- Define variables for constants such as \\verb|Fs| rather than using numbers throughout the code. That way, you give meaning to that number; if the number changes, you have to change it only at a single location.\n",
    "- Avoid the use of globals. If a function needs a parameter, include it in the function call. If you must use globals, write the variable names in capitals. The risk of using globals is that if their value changes, it affects functions that depend on them while that dependency is hidden.\n",
    "- When writing your code, be sure to decouple each function, test it separately, and briefly report on these tests. If you run into any problems further down the design process, finding where functions might not agree and where your problem could lie will be easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test itself should also be in a script, so that you can frequently rerun it in case some of the functions have changed and need to be tested again. \n",
    "- In your report, describe the overall structure of the code and the main variables so that others can quickly find their way into your code.\n",
    "- Test every function in your code! For every `if' statement in the code, you have two branches to test.\n",
