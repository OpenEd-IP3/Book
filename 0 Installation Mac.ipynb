    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through installing Python, Visual Studio Code, and all the necessary dependencies for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of this guide, you will find a section on common problems and solutions. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to that section for troubleshooting tips.\n",

    "## Installing Homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software. We will use Homebrew to install Python and other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Homebrew**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Searche **\"Terminal\"** in Spotlight.\n",
    "   - Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You will be prompted for your password. Enter it to proceed with the installation.\n",
    "   - If prompted with follow-up commands, run them as instructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Homebrew Installation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After installation, verify that Homebrew is installed correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     brew --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This should display the installed Homebrew version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "With Homebrew installed, we can now install Python **3.12** using Homebrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Python 3.12**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the Terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     brew install python@3.12\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This will install Python 3.12 and make it available as `python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the Installation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This should display the installed Python version, e.g., `Python 3.12.0`.\n",
    "   - **Note**: On macOS, `python` may point to Python 2.x. Always use `python3` and `pip3` to invoke Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update PATH (if necessary)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If you encounter issues with the `python3` command, you may need to update your PATH.\n",
    "   - Follow Homebrew's post-installation messages, which may prompt you to add the following to your shell profile (`~/.zprofile` or `~/.bash_profile`):\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python@3.12/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zprofile\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Reload your shell configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     source ~/.zprofile\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). VSCode is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft with a wide range of extensions and excellent Python support.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download VSCode**:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Install VSCode**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Once the installer is downloaded, run it to start the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Launch VSCode**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After the installation is complete, open Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python Extension for VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open VSCode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Extensions View**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - In the same way, search for **\"Jupyter\"**.\n",
    "   - Install the official Jupyter extension by Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reload VSCode**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After installation, you may need to reload VSCode to activate the extensions fully.\n",
    "   - If prompted, click on the **\"Reload\"** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Select the Python Interpreter**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Open the Command Palette by pressing **Command+Shift+P**.\n",
    "   - Type **\"Python: Select Interpreter\"** and select the Python 3.12 interpreter from the list.\n",
    "   - If you don't see it, click on **\"Enter interpreter path...\"** and navigate to `/usr/local/bin/python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning the Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a way to work with Git repositories, you can skip to step 3. If you don't, follow these steps to clone the repository to your computer using VSCode's built-in Git support.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Source Control View in VSCode**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Click on the **Source Control** icon in the Activity Bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Or press **Control+Shift+G**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Git (if not already installed)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If you don't have Git installed, VSCode will display a message and a **\"Download Git\"** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Click the button or in the Terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     brew install git\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
