In this final challenge you are on your own and no explicit steps are provided to help you through the process. Nevertheless, a few hints are given in this chapter on how you could attack the problem (but many alternative solution approaches exist).\n",

    "## Defining your approach\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this second part, it merits to brainstorm with your entire group on the approach\n",
    "that you will take. For your selected approach, determine whether it will do the job (and under what assumptions/conditions). You can opt for a simple and robust “combinatorial” approach (i.e., based on\n",
    "many if-then-else statements), that will be able to handle the expected situations but not more than that,\n",
    "or a more thoughtful approach based on control theory, that is much more robust but also more risky to\n",
    "implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "This high-level system design is part of system engineering, i.e., with the entire system in mind, define\n",
    "an approach at a high level that will do the job, and define specifications of each constituting subsystem.\n",
    "These parts can then be designed by specialists that don’t have to know or consider the entire system. If\n",
    "the parts are tested and verified to meet their specifications, then the entire system is supposed to work.\n",
    "(Or so you would think.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**\n",
    "\n",
    "In your final report, document your selected approach, and the alternatives that you considered, plus your\n",
    "motivation for the selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document the foreseen consequences of this choice. Draw a block scheme that shows what software\n",
    "blocks should interact, and define the interaction (e.g., variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will probably contain a finite state machine and/or a loop. An important consideration is\n",
    "the timing of this loop. Document your analysis of this in sufficient detail. How often do you intend to\n",
    "measure your location, keeping in mind the constraints and trade-offs here. Consider also the various\n",
    "delays in the system. If you obtain a location fix, how old is that information? If you estimate velocity\n",
    "from two locations, then to what time point does that velocity refer? How fast should one iteration of the\n",
    "loop be? (If it is too fast, then you won’t have new location information, but if it is too slow, then you\n",
    "might miss your target.) Can you merge location fixes from the audio beacon with predictions of your\n",
    "position using your car model?\n",

    "The text on this in your final report can be placed into an initial section “Problem definition and analysis”, or “Problem analysis and high-level design”, depending on how you want to organize your report. Alternatively, it can be placed after the localization and car modeling sections, if you need to use information from those sections.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Define a new planned trajectory around the obstacle (possibly requiring driving backwards). Typically, students follow a *combinatorial approach*: lots of if-then-else statements. This works in simple cases. The disadvantage is that it is hard to debug, and the solutions are often not general.\n",

    "The code below implements obstacle detection and avoidance for KITT to complete challenges C and D. It begins by reading data from KITT’s ultrasonic sensors, which detect the distance to obstacles around the car. The function `get_distance_update()` requests distance data and decodes it to extract the distance to obstacles on the left and right sides of the car. The data is updated with an offset of 4%, as specified in the challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the distance to any obstacle is less than or equal to 50 cm, KITT stops. This ensures that it maintains a safe distance from obstacles, matching the requirement from the challenge to avoid collisions with a 50 cm buffer for safety. The position of the obstacle is calculated and printed for reference, allowing KITT to document its location. The car then evaluates whether it should adjust its movement depending on whether the obstacle is on the left or right side, or directly in front.\n",
    "\n",
    " KITT handles situations where it approaches the grid boundaries as if they were obstacles. When it detects that it's near a boundary, KITT stops, adjusts its angle, and backs away to avoid going out of bounds, following the same maneuver as it does with physical obstacles.\n",
