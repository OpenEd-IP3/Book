    "This chapter contains information that you will need when preparing for the second part: the final challenge. The ultimate goal is to let KITT drive from an initial (known) location A to a given target location B. In this final challenge you are on your own and no explicit steps are provided to help you through the process. Nevertheless, a few hints are given in this chapter on how you could attack the problem (but many alternative solution approaches exist).\n",

    "3. You have created an algorithm to estimate the car's location, providing an estimate based on the moment the recording was made. However, keep in mind that the car may have moved while the recordings are being processed (unless you stop the car while localizing it). You also do not know the car's orientation. How can it be estimated? (Taking the difference of two positions is not accurate if you are making a turn, or if the positions are close to each other and both inaccurate.)\n",
    "4. You have developed a virtual car model. You can use it in three ways: \n",
    "    - Track your current position and orientation (give the model the same commands as you give to your real car);\n",
    "    - Determine which commands should be given to reach the destination.\n",

    "### What do you need to make ? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path planning:** You need to determine a path from point A to point B, which would ideally be a straight line. However, keep in mind that KITT has a specific orientation, and you can’t move or turn it exactly as you wish. The path to B is typically a circle followed by a straight line. You could choose to use a circle with a small diameter, and stop turning when the car is headed into the right direction. Alternatively, you could calculate a wide circle such that no straight driving is needed. \n",
    "In both cases, you must calculate how long you want to drive on the intended circle (which depends on your selected velocity as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Path Following:** After defining a path, you need to give commands for the car to stay on the path. The way you do this will vary based on your strategy. E.g., at any new position, you could recalculate your optimal path (drive on a small circle, etc), or you can estimate an error and do error feedback. You will see examples of this in a later course (EE2S2 Systems and Control). A simple technique is to define the error as the difference in the current orientation angle and the angle of the direct line towards the target, and apply proportional error feedback: a larger error gives a larger steering action. You will have to worry about stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Location estimation** As you may have already noticed, having a path and a controller alone can make it seem like the TDOA-based localization function is unnecessary. However, relying solely on a path and a path-following mechanism (i.e., your virtual model) is essentially like driving blind, knowing only the start and end points (an open-loop controller). The model will allow you to drive for about 2 seconds and predict where you are, after that its accuracy is probably insufficient. Therefore, you will have to regularly estimate your position using the TDOA algorithm. The optimal blend of your TDOA-estimated position with the model-based position estimate requires more advanced control theory (Kalman filters) - this is a topic for the MSc. Some of this is presented in the [state tracking notebook](./state-tracking.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "For some guidance on how to plan your path or control the car, you could refer to the notebooks on [path planning](Path-planning.ipynb) and [control](Controller.ipynb). However, this material is readable only after you have done the course EE2S2 Systems and Control."

    "You have the parking sensors to help you detect obstacles, and also the perimeter of the field can be considered an (invisible) obstacle. Once you detect an obstacle, you need to steer around it. You can have the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most structured approach is to create a map of the environment. For example, you can store a 2D grid as an array, which serves as occupancy map. In this grid, any locations where obstacles are detected are marked with a value of 1, indicating that no path can be planned through those areas. When an obstacle is encountered, you halt and generate a new path from your current position to the target, factoring in the updated map.\n",
    " \n",
    " 📝 **Note:** Making a map is probably most complete approach, but it is difficult and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead, a simple approach is to define a new planned trajectory around the obstacle (possibly requiring driving backwards and then making a wide circle). Typically, students follow a *decision tree approach*: lots of if-then-else statements. When driving backwards, you risk driving off the field.\n",
    "\n",
